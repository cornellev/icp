# scan-matching

## Introduction

This repository hosts Ethan's (my) implementation of Iterative Closest Points (ICP) as applied to scan matching.
It is a first step in my attempt to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
Eventually, I will factor this out into its own library as a submodule for the SLAM library I will build.

## Usage

Assuming you have SDL installed (because this repo depends on my [SDL wrapper](https://github.com/cornellev/sdl-wrapper)), you can run
```
make 
```
to launch the interactive window.
Instructions are printed to standard output.
