\page trimmed_icp Trimmed ICP
\par Usage
You can construct a new instance of Trimmed ICP with `icp::ICP::from_method("trimmed", config)`. Supply the following parameters to `config` (via icp::ICP::Config::set):

Key | Description
--- | ---
`"overlap_rate"` | A `double` between 0 and 1 for the overlap rate. The  default is 1. 

\par Description
Trimmed ICP is identical to \ref vanilla_icp with the addition of an
overlap rate parameter, which specifies the percentage of points between the two
point sets that have correspondences. When the overlap rate is 1, the algorithm
reduces to vanilla.

1.     **Matching Step**: see \ref vanilla_icp
    for details.

2.     **Trimming Step**
    
    Matches are considered in increasing order of distance.
