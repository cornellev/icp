The algorithm runs extremely fast now.
We only need it to run at 6hz with our current LiDAR.

It also matches quite well.
Below is the result of running this ICP implementation on two point clouds obtained within the workspace.

However, there is still remove for improvement with regard to outlier rejection and other parts of the algorithm (for instance, adopting a point-to-line metric).
